# JC_Movies-ETL
Module 8: ETL - Extract, Transform, Load!

# Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to make part of the Hackaton with Amazing Prime by providing an overview to a clean list of low budget movies with all the data a viewer will be interested in, such as: Directors, Ratings, Release Year, amongst others.

In order to achieve this, we will be EXTRACTING data from different sources (Wikipedia and Kaggle web data scrape), then TRANSFORMING it through a smart structure following: an INSPECTION, a PLAN and an EXECUTION; for finally, LOADING with PostgresSQL and pgAdmin into a Database.


# Resources:
 
 **Data source** All data used (and exported) in this analysis is in the [Data Folder](https://github.com/juanitacosmica/JC_Movies-ETL/Data) and sample images of the results are in the [Resources Folder](https://github.com/juanitacosmica/JC_Movies-ETL/Resources)

  **Software** Juyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, PgAdmin4, PostgresSQL.


# Results:

Through this process we are creating an automated pipeline to ETL. There are 4 deliverables:

- Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
